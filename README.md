# Flight-Price-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning-
This study aims to analyze the flight booking dataset obtained from the "Ease My Trip" website and conduct various statistical hypothesis tests to extract meaningful insights.
"Ease My Trip" is a popular online platform for booking flight tickets, widely used by potential passengers.

🔍 Key Highlights of the Project:

Data Exploration and Visualization 📊: I analyzed and visualized the dataset to understand the distribution and relationships of different features with flight prices.

Data Preprocessing 🛠️: The data was cleaned and preprocessed, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing the data.

Modeling 🧠: I applied and compared various regression models, including Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVR, XGBoost, KNeighbors, Gradient Boosting, and AdaBoost.

Model Evaluation 📈: The models were evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R² score. The RandomForestRegressor emerged as the best-performing model with an R² score of 0.985.

Findings:

Flight prices vary significantly based on the class, airline, departure time, number of stops, and duration.
The RandomForestRegressor model provided the highest accuracy in predicting flight prices.
